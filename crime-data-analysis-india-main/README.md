## 4. Features / Highlights  

### Business Problem  
Extensive crime data exists across Indian cities but lacks meaningful visualization, making it hard for stakeholders to devise targeted safety strategies.

### Goal of the Dashboard  
- Provide an intuitive, interactive tool to explore crime trends by time, location, and category.  
- Support data-driven decision-making for resource allocation, rapid response, and policy formulation.

### Key Insights
- Crime rates peaked in 2022 across Tier-1 cities, particularly in cybercrime.
- Areas with higher police deployment showed better case closure rates.
- Weapon usage patterns vary drastically by crime domain and location.
